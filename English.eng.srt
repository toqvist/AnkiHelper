3
00:01:57,077 --> 00:02:00,725
This is the 52nd annual celebration
of the October Revolution

4
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:03,975
taking place in November
in Moscow's Red Square.

5
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,497
AFTER WORLD WAR II POLAND WAS SURRENDERED
TO THE COMMUNIST SOVIET EMPIRE

6
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:11,211
Moscow Military District troops,
including the Armored Missile Divisions

7
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:14,459
parade in front of party leaders
and members of government.

8
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,981
IN 1980, FOLLOWING SEVERAL ATTEMPTS
AT RESISTANCE, POLES CREATED "SOLIDARITY",

9
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:20,506
A 10-MILLIONS-STRONG OPPOSITION MOVEMENT
HEADED BY LECH WAŁĘSA

10
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:49,906
WALESA
MAN OF HOPE

11
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:53,375
WRITTEN BY

12
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:07,075
- We have company again.
- That's possible.

13
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:09,784
Can they stop us?

14
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:13,109
The most famous journalist
from the West?

15
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,128
They're here for our safety.

16
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:21,270
It seems to me that this interview
could be very inconvenient for them.

17
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:27,971
Boys, clear up your toys.

18
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:31,462
Go wash your hands.
Sławek, take this away.

19
00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:33,518
I'll check your hands, all right?

20
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:38,836
- A white shirt.
- No. I didn't want this interview.

21
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,856
Bogdan, take this.

22
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:44,827
Wear a tie at least.

23
00:03:50,626 --> 00:03:54,147
No! I'm not going to suffocate
for that brazen hag.

24
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,957
This is the home of the man
who leads a 10-million-member union?

25
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:27,728
He was recently given this place
by the authorities.

26
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,111
He accepted an apartment
from the authorities he's opposing?

27
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:39,816
Six kids and no money to live on.
'Solidarity' didn't protest.

28
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:45,461
Are you sure?
What is he like?

29
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:50,529
He's full of contradictions.
And surprises.

30
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:05,945
I'm Oriana Fallaci.

31
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,977
It is a cold afternoon in Gdańsk,
blanketed with snow and anxiety.

32
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:11,687
Wait, wait, wait.

33
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:15,452
Before we begin, we need to
agree on a few things.

34
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:21,052
I'm a simple worker,
but I don't feel inferior...

35
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:24,898
Not inferior to generals,
to prime ministers or to you.

36
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:28,599
So let me ask the first question:

37
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:32,219
Will this interview help me or hurt me?

38
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:36,473
Listen, Mr. Wałęsa.

39
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:38,931
I can't tell you if you will
benefit from this or not.

40
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,004
It really depends on what you say.

41
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:44,213
And I'm the one asking questions.
Let's begin.

42
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:51,358
7 months ago, hardly anybody
knew your name abroad or in Poland.

43
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:54,636
Today you're one of the most famous
people in the world.

44
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:58,365
When you're in Italy, you're welcomed
like a head of state. A movie star...

45
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,261
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

46
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:01,418
Why?

47
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:04,995
You have an authoritarian,
dictatorial style.

48
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:09,360
I do, too. So now we have a problem.

49
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:12,898
Let's try this: I'll be nice to you
and you'll be nice to me.

50
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:15,459
Otherwise, we'll tear
each other to pieces.

51
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:17,732
We've talked once before. Why again?

52
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:21,268
Because I need to make sure
I've understood you correctly.

53
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:29,388
Brezhnev was clear on one thing: in Poland,
enemies of socialism are carrying out

54
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,385
counterrevolutionary activities.

55
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:38,006
And the Soviet Union will never
abandon its communist Polish allies.

56
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:41,287
This is only barking
meant to scare people off.

57
00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:50,261
Aren't you afraid of responsibility
towards your country and history?

58
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:55,329
- No, no, no...
- Or that you're not the right person?

59
00:06:56,098 --> 00:07:01,244
I am a man of faith and I know
that the times call for someone like me.

60
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:05,073
DECEMBER 1970

61
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:09,576
12 December 1970
the Council of Ministers has approved

62
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,086
an increase in prices of consumer goods.

63
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:18,523
The prices of meat preserves
are rising by 17.6%.

64
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:21,902
Wheat and rye flour by 16%.

65
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:25,312
Milk - 8%.

66
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:30,823
Jam and marmalade - 36.8%.

67
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:35,573
Roasted grain coffee - 92.1%.

68
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:39,260
Cream of wheat - 23%.

69
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,305
I made it, I'm here!
Go now, Mr. Wałęsa!

70
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,493
Thank God you've taken a day off.

71
00:08:50,606 --> 00:08:51,873
Go, go!

72
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:55,006
I'll wipe Danuta's feet myself.

73
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:57,547
Put on something warm.
It's freezing.

74
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:01,191
Lech!

75
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:04,686
Where's your scarf?

76
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:11,918
- I'll do it.
- No, you shouldn't bend over.

77
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,534
Your hair must be done. Don't want you
looking like this in the delivery room.

78
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:23,395
Eyebrows, too. Do you like them thick
or do you prefer a 'surprised' look?

79
00:09:24,782 --> 00:09:27,019
And I'll throw in a perm for free.

80
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:41,141
Right. How on earth
am I going to pay for Christmas? Eh?

81
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:43,905
Meat and sugar prices are up by 30%.

82
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:49,610
If I had a cripple or a baby at home,
I could skip the line at the shop...

83
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:54,344
And those bastards boast about
the falling cost of train engines. And?

84
00:09:55,272 --> 00:09:59,060
- It works great. Like a Mercedes.
- What else did you expect?

85
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,668
- Only three of these in the whole city.
- I don't know how to repay you.

86
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:08,494
Let's leave through the back door.
You know how envious people get.

87
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,974
Krysia! Hurry up.
We're closing shop.

88
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:15,662
- It's a war out there!
- What?

89
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,542
The shipyard workers are out on the streets!

90
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:25,947
GDAŃSK
14 DECEMBER, 1970

91
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,233
It's gorgeous!

92
00:10:44,654 --> 00:10:46,465
The city is in real turmoil.

93
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:47,849
What?

94
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:55,283
Beautiful.

95
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,225
How are you, Danuta?

96
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:03,628
I'll be right back.

97
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,033
- There's bloodshed in the streets.
- What are you saying?

98
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:14,261
Sell these if I don't come back.

99
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
Lech!

100
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:22,440
Lech!

101
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,361
People, control yourselves!

102
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:08,718
Calm down!

103
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:29,044
Calm down!

104
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:30,105
Go away!

105
00:12:32,558 --> 00:12:34,555
Don't let them provoke you!

106
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:48,725
Rysiek!

107
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:51,313
Rysiek!

108
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,626
- How did it go?
- I have at least 30 signatures.

109
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:34,614
Last name?

110
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:35,649
Wałęsa.

111
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:37,723
- First name?
- Lech.

112
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:42,292
- Father's name?
- Bolesław.

113
00:13:42,984 --> 00:13:44,021
Date of birth?

114
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:47,976
September 29, 1943.

115
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:52,738
- Place?
- Popowo, Bydgoszcz district.

116
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:59,130
- Occupation?
- Electrician.

117
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:01,418
What kind?

118
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:02,750
Wałęsa the Electrician.

119
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:04,805
- You want me to punch him?
- Wait.

120
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:07,938
Let the bastard show off.
Place of employment?

121
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,706
Gdansk Shipyards, Department W4,
I deal with installations.

122
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,699
- Address?
- Gdansk, Beethoven Str. 30d.

123
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:18,466
Education?

124
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,963
- Basic vocational school in Lipno.
- Marital status?

125
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,820
Married. That's the thing...

126
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,929
My wife's about to give birth
to our first child. She's all alone.

127
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,526
Hands on the table.

128
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,554
- Were you on the Strike Committee?
- I was.

129
00:14:32,615 --> 00:14:35,740
- You were pushing for revolt.
- I'm all for compromise.

130
00:14:35,822 --> 00:14:39,179
- You started a counter-revolution.
- It's the government that started it.

131
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,795
- You were seen demolishing shops.
- You set fire to the Committee Building.

132
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:46,267
But my wife... I don't even know
if it's a boy or a girl.

133
00:14:46,382 --> 00:14:48,726
You'll find out... 5 years from now.

134
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:50,990
Hands on the table!

135
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:56,196
- I did not demolish anything.
- You were instigating a riot.

136
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:58,605
I was trying to stop them.

137
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:01,236
- We have 7 witnesses.
- I have a witness, too.

138
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:04,715
- Who? A Jehovah's witness?
- The local militia commander.

139
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:07,925
You wanted to overthrow the government.

140
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,573
- I was trying to calm people down.
- We'll see. Nawiślak, call Walczewski.

141
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:19,214
Does "Wałęsa" ring a bell?

142
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:27,816
Walczewski says there was a guy
with a mustache trying to stop the riot.

143
00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:30,850
Well, well. You're in luck.

144
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:35,726
Sign this, lucky guy.
And get out!

145
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:40,034
- What is this? A witness statement?
- None of your business. Sign it.

146
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:48,406
- And this.
- What's this?

147
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,579
Says here you will obey the law.

148
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,218
- Why should I sign this?
- Don't you want to obey the law?

149
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:56,084
- I do.
- Then sign it.

150
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:08,635
And this.

151
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:10,058
Sit!

152
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,822
What's this?

153
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:16,135
- You want me to be a snitch?
- Can't you read?

154
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,232
You will visit us as a consultant
from time to time.

155
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,342
To prevent further misfortune.

156
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:27,269
Do you want us to let you go?
We're all decent people here.

157
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:32,674
Don't worry about your family.
We'll take care of your son...

158
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:34,365
Son?

159
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:36,775
- ...and of your wife.
- I have a son...?

160
00:16:37,051 --> 00:16:38,280
For now you do.

161
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:43,502
Are you signing it or not?
There are others waiting.

162
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,178
You're free to go, Wałęsa.

163
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,045
Danuta...

164
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:32,885
You're here...

165
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:35,498
My son.

166
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,664
I have a son.

167
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,701
They let you out.
Are you hurt?

168
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:51,385
Just an interrogation.
And then I signed something.

169
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:55,003
Lech, what did you sign?

170
00:17:58,229 --> 00:18:02,099
They said they'd hurt you or the baby
so I would have signed anything

171
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:04,466
apart from the betrayal
of God or my country.

172
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:05,871
How did you get in here?

173
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:08,059
- Please get out.
- This is my son.

174
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:09,996
No visitors are allowed.

175
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:13,934
- I have the right to see my son.
- You're not allowed in here.

176
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:31,083
When did you realize you're a leader?

177
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:35,514
My friends ask: Why do you interfere?
But I like interfering.

178
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,124
In December 1970 and August 1980,
I interfered...

179
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,024
Because nobody else wanted to.
When I worked for the opposition,

180
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:47,069
I was the only one willing
to go to meetings.

181
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,148
I was the only one
who wanted to speak.

182
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:56,006
Today it's the same, because I know
how far we can go with our demands.

183
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:57,988
I know the reality of this country.

184
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:02,587
Polish Film Chronicle, 1971

185
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,461
A special Central Party Committee
has made an emergency assessment

186
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:08,591
of the dramatic events in Gdańsk.

187
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:12,766
The new head of the Committee, Edward
Gierek, has arrived at the Shipyard.

188
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:16,064
I urgently appeal to all shipyard workers

189
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,078
GDAŃSK SHIPYARD
JANUARY 1971

190
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:20,592
and to all working people of Poland.

191
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:26,873
Our aim is to reach consensus.
Therefore, we need your support.

192
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,853
So, you will help us, won't you?

193
00:19:58,037 --> 00:19:59,995
Hey! Mijak! Mijak!

194
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,120
No mask? Are you crazy?

195
00:20:05,102 --> 00:20:07,785
Come on. Let's go. Careful.

196
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,010
Director?

197
00:20:16,054 --> 00:20:19,038
As a labor inspector, I've made
several requests for equipment.

198
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:21,365
Haven't I? For safety masks?

199
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,110
Sand-blasting without a mask
is not allowed.

200
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:28,116
Is that funny to you?

201
00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:32,252
Why talk to me?
You've got the union.

202
00:20:32,443 --> 00:20:36,091
The union takes care of its own holidays,
not our safety masks.

203
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:40,331
Listen, friend, the director is too busy to
deal with an employee's personal business.

204
00:20:40,392 --> 00:20:42,552
It's not personal business,
it's the workers' business.

205
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:46,095
Then get back to work, workers!
Unless you don't like your jobs here.

206
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:57,979
Why aren't you working?

207
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:02,434
What's going on?

208
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:05,083
- A power cut.
- Again?

209
00:21:06,811 --> 00:21:11,342
- Power cut? How can we do our work?
- You'll work through the night.

210
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:15,482
Those guys will learn how to play
before we get the power back.

211
00:21:16,023 --> 00:21:18,194
Do something, Lech.
You are a social labor inspector.

212
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:20,206
What do you want me to do about it?

213
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:24,491
Man, as a labor resource,
can achieve incredible goals.

214
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:31,119
Working under our leaders' guidance is a
source of pride, joy, and inspiration.

215
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:34,964
However, under capitalism,
it's a whole different matter.

216
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:38,783
There, the working class
must constantly defend its rights.

217
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:43,368
Therefore I move that
we declare our support

218
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,438
for striking dockers in Brazil
and farmers in Thailand.

219
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,512
Who's in favor?

220
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:52,931
Raise your hands higher.

221
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:54,888
Who's against?

222
00:21:56,122 --> 00:21:57,218
I can't see anyone.

223
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:02,578
And one more issue to be presented
on behalf of the staff by Czesław Mijak.

224
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,317
As imperialism tiptoes around us,
on its wolf's feet,

225
00:22:15,394 --> 00:22:17,907
it is our duty to kill it off.

226
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:22,783
Since each year brings
further progress in our work,

227
00:22:22,936 --> 00:22:27,080
I motion for the introduction

228
00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:32,981
of voluntary penalties for those

229
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:36,572
who failed to meet last year's goals.

230
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,260
You want us to steal from ourselves?

231
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:41,827
Leave it.

232
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:44,287
Potatoes are more expensive
than our ships.

233
00:22:44,347 --> 00:22:51,489
Are power failures our fault?
And shortages of sheet metal?

234
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,792
First Secretary Gierek broke
his promises, cheated the nation.

235
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:58,415
He does as he pleases, without the
consent of the working class.

236
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:02,012
Silence! What is this?

237
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:06,197
Stop all this! The issue is settled!

238
00:23:06,312 --> 00:23:10,410
You've had your consultations.
That was a chance to have your say.

239
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,403
We're having a vote
on Comrade Mijak's proposal.

240
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,542
Let's vote democratically.
Openly. Who's in favor?

241
00:23:22,018 --> 00:23:23,170
Who's against?

242
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:27,299
I see we have a controversy.

243
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:30,350
I'll break the bastard in two.
Goddamn snitch!

244
00:23:36,494 --> 00:23:38,299
Where does Mijak live?

245
00:23:59,074 --> 00:24:00,307
Good. You're here...

246
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:03,978
They stole the door to the john
And there's a draft now.

247
00:24:04,296 --> 00:24:08,520
- Father's sick. Electricity's weak.
- Shhh... Shut it, woman!

248
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,930
They're not here to help
but to get revenge.

249
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:21,077
Close the door, then.
Invite your guests in.

250
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:26,693
No, no, we'll be going.
Maybe some other time.

251
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:30,946
Let's drop it...

252
00:24:38,585 --> 00:24:39,800
Go on, beat me up.

253
00:24:40,622 --> 00:24:44,517
They gave me wood for the stove

254
00:24:44,578 --> 00:24:47,642
and promised
to hook up electricity.

255
00:24:49,518 --> 00:24:50,518
Mijak.

256
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:54,792
I'll hook it up for you.

257
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,054
What are you doing?

258
00:25:04,507 --> 00:25:08,671
Lech, let's go. You promised
to help me with the laundry.

259
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:12,932
- Catch some sun. I'll help tomorrow.
- You're working tomorrow.

260
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:14,952
The thing is, I'm not.

261
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:17,026
- How come?
- Just like that.

262
00:25:17,755 --> 00:25:21,305
Jesus! They fired you?
What did you do this time?

263
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,616
I said one thing too many.

264
00:25:24,676 --> 00:25:26,716
Tell me exactly what you said.

265
00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:30,229
That Gierek has betrayed
the working class.

266
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,557
Jesus Christ!

267
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:36,477
That they're traitors, they didn't build
a monument for people they killed in 1970.

268
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:40,565
How are we going to pay for things?

269
00:25:41,947 --> 00:25:42,947
We'll manage.

270
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:49,166
Now, where are the stones?

271
00:26:04,987 --> 00:26:07,598
Who taught you to act this way?

272
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:13,128
I am a man full of great internal anger.

273
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:18,043
I've had this anger in my heart
since I was a little boy.

274
00:26:18,965 --> 00:26:26,184
And when you build up this much anger,
you start to be able to use it cleverly.

275
00:26:34,056 --> 00:26:38,165
This is why I can control crowds
and I can control strikes.

276
00:26:40,354 --> 00:26:45,384
One has to be full of anger in order
to control the holy anger of people.

277
00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:47,792
One has to be able
to live with anger.

278
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:45,941
"THE WORKER", 1978

279
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:51,125
- Lech, please stay away from this.
- What if I can't?

280
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:55,746
They fired you from the shipyard.
You want to lose this new job, too?

281
00:28:10,478 --> 00:28:11,478
And the bread?

282
00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:29,141
- What do they want?
- Who?

283
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,189
KOR. The Workers' Defense Committee.

284
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:39,586
Society's only defense against
injustice is solidarity.

285
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,620
And mutual help.

286
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:47,244
That's why we, Polish intellectuals,
have established KOR,

287
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:50,568
the Workers' Defense Committee.

288
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:55,867
Its aim is to defend
and help the workers.

289
00:28:57,211 --> 00:28:59,208
Signed by Jerzy Andrzejewski.

290
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,291
And they've put their addresses too.

291
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:07,695
Oh, there's more. We demand
an amnesty for all arrested workers.

292
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:12,648
As well as restoring them to their jobs.

293
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:15,722
This is good thinking.

294
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:21,224
HUNGER STRIKE

295
00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:23,326
Good evening.

296
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,027
I'd like to say that your diagnosis is right
but your methods are shitty.

297
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:32,043
You're either a horseman or a horse.
You can't be both.

298
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:36,955
The Commies are sucking our blood,
and you're starving to spite them?

299
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:40,783
Where's the logic? This is not
the way to corner the beast.

300
00:29:40,872 --> 00:29:45,019
Even if cornered, it can use its claws
and meanwhile you die of hunger.

301
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:52,584
You write about breaking the law,
labor ethics, workers' dignity...

302
00:29:53,275 --> 00:29:57,840
Start from the grassroots. The ground,
the shoes, the socks, the black sausage...

303
00:29:58,843 --> 00:30:00,878
Also, you're too smart for me.

304
00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:04,415
And even I myself am too smart
for the regular worker.

305
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:07,506
I want to support your cause,
because it's a just cause.

306
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:09,838
Any cause I choose to support will win.

307
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,065
To sum up, your intentions are fine.
The rest is garbage.

308
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:15,585
I have to go.

309
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:20,825
Wait, wait. Who are you?

310
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:24,406
- What's your name?
- Lech Wałęsa. I thought I'd talk to you.

311
00:30:24,494 --> 00:30:30,024
I need to go. My youngest is sick.
Here's my address if you need me.

312
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,251
Good bye.

313
00:30:32,674 --> 00:30:33,480
Good bye.

314
00:30:33,595 --> 00:30:37,089
What a guy - a working class chauvinist.

315
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:40,273
He's got balls, though.
But what if he's one of them?

316
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:44,174
- Why would he be?
- He's the only one who came in sober.

317
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:46,767
Let's see if he comes back.

318
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:17,737
Lech, have a look.

319
00:31:20,635 --> 00:31:22,127
We're writing about you.

320
00:31:41,294 --> 00:31:43,626
Citizen! Stop!

321
00:31:44,144 --> 00:31:45,495
Your ID, please.

322
00:31:48,168 --> 00:31:50,165
Let me smell your breath.

323
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,268
- Don't touch this.
- Why?

324
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:00,148
That's illegal.

325
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:08,306
Next time, don't use alcohol for printing.
You can smell it a mile off.

326
00:32:08,366 --> 00:32:12,283
Leave it! Leave the baby!
Leave the pram!

327
00:32:21,614 --> 00:32:22,749
What's this?

328
00:32:24,187 --> 00:32:26,069
- What's going on here?
- What do you mean?

329
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,507
The kid's pissing on the floor.

330
00:32:27,568 --> 00:32:29,705
- Her diaper needs changing.
- Then do it!

331
00:32:29,766 --> 00:32:32,876
- I don't have one.
- Bring us a diaper.

332
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:35,208
A diaper. Now!

333
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:45,345
- Will a towel do?
- A bloody one? From an interrogation?

334
00:32:45,845 --> 00:32:48,571
Bring a new one.
Not from the toilets!

335
00:33:09,115 --> 00:33:13,877
Lock him up when he's done.
With the pram.

336
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:27,490
What's going on here?

337
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,704
- Why is the kid crying?
- She's hungry.

338
00:33:42,485 --> 00:33:44,115
Jesus! What are you doing?

339
00:33:44,174 --> 00:33:48,552
Don't worry, I'm healthy.
I've just given birth myself...

340
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:51,701
Mine's a girl, too. Come on...

341
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:08,969
Why are you wearing this filthy thing?
The uniform?

342
00:34:09,058 --> 00:34:12,706
Should I go around naked?
My husband left me with three kids.

343
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:19,976
This child should be at home.
You're putting her at risk.

344
00:34:20,103 --> 00:34:22,737
Let her see what kind
of country she lives in.

345
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:26,438
When is it going to end?

346
00:34:26,552 --> 00:34:29,010
Soon. It will end soon.

347
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:40,641
Those guys are far more scared
than you.

348
00:34:41,197 --> 00:34:45,230
- You think they won't open fire?
- I sincerely doubt it.

349
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,313
Good morning, Mrs. Danuta.

350
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:51,753
Where is my husband?
What are you doing here?

351
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:54,715
We've missed you.

352
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:06,364
Have you seen my ball, mister?

353
00:35:07,381 --> 00:35:08,840
I've lost it.

354
00:35:11,534 --> 00:35:14,529
You brutes don't even show
respect for a woman.

355
00:35:15,298 --> 00:35:17,688
Why don't you get your gun
and shoot us?

356
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,827
- Easy, lady.
- Do you have a warrant?

357
00:35:20,888 --> 00:35:22,848
I won't calm down
because you say so.

358
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:25,098
Here you are.
It's a regular search.

359
00:35:27,317 --> 00:35:31,541
What are you rummaging in there for?
Do you have no shame?

360
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,823
If you're hungry, I will make you
something to eat.

361
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:40,109
Such attractive men and such pigs.
What are you doing there?

362
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:45,749
The broadcast!

363
00:35:53,429 --> 00:35:56,063
Long live the Pope!

364
00:35:59,765 --> 00:36:02,223
On the eve of Pentecost,

365
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,943
I join you in calling out:

366
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:11,323
Lord, let your Spirit descend.

367
00:36:12,898 --> 00:36:16,508
Let your Spirit descend

368
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:24,457
and revive the face of the Earth,
the face of this land, of this country.

369
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:51,968
Is that your pram downstairs, Danuta?

370
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:55,246
Jesus Almighty!
It's my Magda!

371
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:19,061
Lech. You have visitors.

372
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:31,003
- Good morning.
- Will I be needed?

373
00:37:31,157 --> 00:37:33,538
No. Not at all.

374
00:37:35,995 --> 00:37:38,782
- Sit down, Mr. Wałęsa.
- No thanks, I'll stand.

375
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:43,778
- I just want to say, before you ask...
- We are not asking.

376
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,077
We're only worried about you.
You're so pale,

377
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:50,203
your hands are shaking.

378
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:52,776
Nothing is shaking.
May I go now?

379
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:56,884
Sit down.
Have a smoke.

380
00:37:58,536 --> 00:38:00,903
I'll smoke,
but I'm telling you nothing.

381
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:08,885
- Are you a Pole?
- What else would I be?

382
00:38:09,096 --> 00:38:12,646
Then why do you keep pushing
Poland into a precipice?

383
00:38:12,706 --> 00:38:15,624
Me? I told you I wouldn't talk.

384
00:38:16,123 --> 00:38:17,736
But you used to talk.

385
00:38:19,152 --> 00:38:20,381
Right. True.

386
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,214
In the past I talked,
because I didn't have a choice.

387
00:38:28,258 --> 00:38:33,305
We had a good rapport.
As representatives of law and order

388
00:38:33,365 --> 00:38:35,323
we appreciate your cooperation.

389
00:38:35,477 --> 00:38:37,090
And I regret it.

390
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:42,277
- I've told the opposition about this.
- Don't be such a smart-ass!

391
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:47,776
You signed the paper! You have 5 kids?
Your wife doesn't work, does she?

392
00:38:48,302 --> 00:38:51,007
You will crawl begging for bread.

393
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:54,843
Do you want to be fired from here
like you were fired from the shipyard?

394
00:38:55,388 --> 00:38:56,539
No need to shout!

395
00:38:57,058 --> 00:39:03,701
I will never forsake my membership
in the Free Trade Union! Never!

396
00:39:04,584 --> 00:39:06,849
And I will not be
disturbed at work.

397
00:39:07,814 --> 00:39:09,619
I'm going back to my work.

398
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,147
I'm not afraid of the consequences.

399
00:39:27,906 --> 00:39:30,448
You know, I've been arrested
lots of times.

400
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:35,227
Usually for 48 hours.
The prison's a good place for thinking.

401
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,453
You're locked up.
There's no noise.

402
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:43,982
I invented a system
for letting people know I was arrested.

403
00:39:44,136 --> 00:39:47,551
Being in jail is pointless
if people don't know about it.

404
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:55,234
And how does your wife cope
with all this?

405
00:39:59,074 --> 00:40:04,220
My wife is not bad at all.
I should say she's an ideal wife.

406
00:40:05,563 --> 00:40:09,211
If it wasn't for her,
I'd be either divorced or dead.

407
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,091
Stabbed with a kitchen knife.

408
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:17,388
So I have no reason
to cheat on her.

409
00:40:19,098 --> 00:40:23,514
And our 6 kids prove that
we make love often and we make it well.

410
00:40:25,954 --> 00:40:30,447
Sometimes there are temptations.

411
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:34,133
I've told you already, I'm no saint.

412
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:39,739
Let's hope the Pope doesn't read this.

413
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:42,888
He's intelligent.
He understands people.

414
00:40:43,464 --> 00:40:45,707
Militia calls it the fitness trail.

415
00:40:46,536 --> 00:40:49,820
They will beat you here,
on the knee and the thigh.

416
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:52,785
When you fall,
they'll hit your kidneys.

417
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:54,907
You must control your fear.

418
00:40:55,637 --> 00:40:59,976
Once you're walking,
keep your head protected.

419
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:05,006
But remember,
they don't want to cripple you.

420
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:07,272
They want to break your resolve.

421
00:41:07,886 --> 00:41:11,856
To make you an offer you can't refuse.
When they see you've had enough,

422
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:16,603
they give you a piece of paper,
And say: "Sign it, you'll be released".

423
00:41:17,448 --> 00:41:22,210
No big deal. A promise to follow
the law. Just sign it. Then you're off.

424
00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:26,027
And this you should be afraid of.

425
00:41:26,549 --> 00:41:30,389
Because one day someone will use
this piece of paper against you.

426
00:41:46,478 --> 00:41:48,289
I've got it! I bought it.

427
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,396
Good.

428
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:55,272
- Let's play, Dad.
- Not now. Go to the kitchen.

429
00:41:55,733 --> 00:41:58,229
Go on. Put the bread on the table.

430
00:42:05,448 --> 00:42:06,907
What's up?

431
00:42:10,786 --> 00:42:11,976
What?

432
00:42:14,702 --> 00:42:16,204
They fired me.

433
00:42:23,803 --> 00:42:25,045
Danuta...

434
00:42:33,902 --> 00:42:35,169
Don't cry.

435
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,327
We're going to make it.

436
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:51,067
Don't worry. I'll find something.

437
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:59,319
People's cars break down.
I'll fix cars.

438
00:43:01,243 --> 00:43:02,329
It will be OK.

439
00:43:13,662 --> 00:43:14,968
I can't take this...

440
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:16,949
It's all right. Don't worry.

441
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:36,224
Recent actions undertaken
by the authorities

442
00:43:36,341 --> 00:43:38,385
have nothing to do with patriotism.

443
00:43:38,446 --> 00:43:43,553
They're ruthless towards real patriots,
they break fundamental laws.

444
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:49,875
My name is Lech Wałęsa.
I was fired from the Gdansk Shipyard

445
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:52,315
after 10 years of impeccable work.

446
00:43:53,813 --> 00:43:58,767
Next year marks the 10th anniversary
of the bloody riots in December 1970.

447
00:44:00,072 --> 00:44:02,491
We must build a monument.

448
00:44:06,754 --> 00:44:08,824
If there is no monument until then,

449
00:44:08,904 --> 00:44:13,166
I ask everyone coming to the
memorial service to bring a stone.

450
00:44:14,395 --> 00:44:18,270
If everyone brings one, we can
build a monument out of those stones.

451
00:44:24,379 --> 00:44:28,267
It will be a unique monument,
because the situation was unprecedented.

452
00:44:28,328 --> 00:44:31,574
The Communist authorities
opened fire on their own people.

453
00:44:31,906 --> 00:44:35,247
We want the law to overcome lawlessness.

454
00:44:36,283 --> 00:44:40,353
We don't ever want Poles
to have to fight one another.

455
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,887
- He can speak.
- People love to listen to him.

456
00:44:47,342 --> 00:44:51,451
If I'm not here next year -
my name's Lech Wałęsa - come get me.

457
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:56,440
But if I am here and some of you
are not, I will come and find you.

458
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:18,447
And? Was that worth it?

459
00:45:44,443 --> 00:45:45,728
Already?

460
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:09,023
- There's no sugar, no milk for kids...
- No needles. Bloody needles.

461
00:46:09,365 --> 00:46:11,583
Or thread. There's nothing at all.

462
00:46:11,899 --> 00:46:15,355
35 years after the war
and you can't buy needles? Jesus.

463
00:46:15,586 --> 00:46:19,653
We're going to starve to death.
And the people at the top see nothing...

464
00:46:23,957 --> 00:46:25,605
Rich Man, Poor Man.

465
00:46:31,483 --> 00:46:33,288
"Rich Man, Poor Man" is on!

466
00:46:46,997 --> 00:46:50,069
Jesus, who can this be?

467
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,156
At this hour it can only be
the Security Service.

468
00:46:53,218 --> 00:46:54,870
I'll go and see.

469
00:46:59,746 --> 00:47:01,029
This won't take a minute.

470
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,748
- We're watching a show.
- We won't disturb.

471
00:47:07,656 --> 00:47:09,653
- What is it?
- We need to talk.

472
00:47:11,534 --> 00:47:13,531
They're listening. Come on up.

473
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:23,263
- It's in three days.
- What's in three days?

474
00:47:23,323 --> 00:47:26,612
- There's lies, poverty and lawlessness.
- I know that. But what's in 3 days?

475
00:47:26,673 --> 00:47:28,898
You know they fired
Anna Walentynowicz?

476
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,017
Everyone knows that.
It was revenge for her criticism.

477
00:47:32,078 --> 00:47:34,420
Just before her retirement,
an old woman...

478
00:47:34,498 --> 00:47:37,309
To humiliate her, let her die of hunger.
So it's in three days.

479
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:38,561
What?

480
00:47:39,912 --> 00:47:41,909
A strike in the shipyard.

481
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:46,834
- People won't be ready.
- If we don't act now, they will lock us up.

482
00:47:46,895 --> 00:47:48,793
You're the leader.

483
00:47:49,973 --> 00:47:51,509
Lech, who else could do this?

484
00:47:51,586 --> 00:47:55,618
For one, you are 100% Polish.
A Catholic, with a wife and 5 kids.

485
00:47:55,771 --> 00:47:57,998
Six kids. Jesus, in three days?

486
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:00,549
You were on the strike committee
in December 1970.

487
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:02,376
People respect you.

488
00:48:18,274 --> 00:48:19,569
It's today.

489
00:48:41,736 --> 00:48:44,424
- Didn't I tell you?
- You didn't.

490
00:48:44,616 --> 00:48:47,150
- He's not here.
- I can see he's not.

491
00:48:49,262 --> 00:48:54,216
- Maybe they've caught him.
- Or he's out drunk somewhere.

492
00:48:55,214 --> 00:48:59,438
Lech? We've paid him a visit,
we talked about this. So?

493
00:48:59,592 --> 00:49:01,090
Do we wait or what?

494
00:49:01,243 --> 00:49:03,281
- People won't follow us.
- Or maybe they will.

495
00:49:03,342 --> 00:49:06,308
We're young. We have no families.
We're kids who risk nothing.

496
00:49:06,369 --> 00:49:09,700
But they know and respect Lech.
So let's give him more time.

497
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:13,378
How much longer? I'm starving.

498
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,989
Let's start without him!

499
00:49:20,405 --> 00:49:22,363
People, move it, it's a strike!

500
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:27,432
We're on strike! All shipyards!

501
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,791
- All of them?
- Say it's all of them!

502
00:49:29,851 --> 00:49:31,848
The ship repair yard is on hold!

503
00:49:33,883 --> 00:49:35,062
Let's go!

504
00:49:36,187 --> 00:49:37,410
It's a strike!

505
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:56,193
Comrades! Have mercy on your country!

506
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:58,267
No one had mercy on us.

507
00:49:58,997 --> 00:49:59,997
People!

508
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:04,221
Comrades!

509
00:50:07,906 --> 00:50:09,365
So it has started!

510
00:50:12,514 --> 00:50:15,663
They started without me.
I was supposed to be there.

511
00:50:17,813 --> 00:50:21,999
I'm not visiting you in prison,
or at the cemetery.

512
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,803
They won't shoot this time.

513
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:30,255
I know this, so I'm telling you,
I wouldn't say it if I wasn't sure.

514
00:50:30,475 --> 00:50:33,304
You want to take on the military,
the militia and Gierek?

515
00:50:33,365 --> 00:50:35,784
They're making me take them on.

516
00:50:36,782 --> 00:50:40,622
I know the best case scenario
is that they hurt me real bad.

517
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:43,341
I don't want to do this.
But I've got to.

518
00:50:43,848 --> 00:50:47,063
I managed to get some meat.
Pork shoulder and sausage.

519
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:51,792
And remember this:
Whatever you do, come back alive.

520
00:51:13,531 --> 00:51:16,370
Sell it if I don't come back.

521
00:51:17,986 --> 00:51:19,132
Lech!

522
00:51:20,866 --> 00:51:22,940
The wheel's come off.

523
00:52:10,517 --> 00:52:12,744
He's on the way to the shipyard?

524
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:20,616
I'd say 'yes', but remember what happened
in 1970 after we got their leaders?

525
00:52:24,379 --> 00:52:28,795
No! But if he reaches the shipyard,
I'll hold you personally responsible.

526
00:52:30,946 --> 00:52:32,136
I forbid it!

527
00:52:33,864 --> 00:52:35,861
You decide for yourselves.

528
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:39,410
Why ask me, anyway?
Suddenly no one wants to decide.

529
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:43,195
Neither Warsaw nor District
want anything to do with this.

530
00:52:43,925 --> 00:52:47,491
I heard they even called Gierek
on holiday but they didn't reach him.

531
00:53:13,378 --> 00:53:14,568
Stop!

532
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:31,633
Enough lawlessness and thuggery!

533
00:53:31,886 --> 00:53:34,305
People, calm down!

534
00:53:36,456 --> 00:53:39,259
Please calm down!

535
00:53:39,605 --> 00:53:41,225
We're on strike.

536
00:53:48,552 --> 00:53:50,203
Do you recognize me?

537
00:53:50,434 --> 00:53:53,330
I worked at the shipyard
for 10 years. I was fired.

538
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:57,237
But deep down I am a shipyard worker
because people still trust me.

539
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:04,575
We will defend Anna Walentynowicz.
We're starting a sit-down strike.

540
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:13,205
Poland can't afford work stoppages.
All right. Bring in your representatives.

541
00:54:14,165 --> 00:54:16,865
The rest of you, please go back to work.

542
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:24,533
Here are our demands.

543
00:54:24,955 --> 00:54:26,837
A 2000 zloty raise for everyone.

544
00:54:26,952 --> 00:54:30,054
A monument for those killed
in December 1970.

545
00:54:30,485 --> 00:54:33,065
Anna Walentynowicz
must get her job back.

546
00:54:39,048 --> 00:54:40,584
Have a seat.

547
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:46,574
Under the circumstances

548
00:54:47,342 --> 00:54:51,758
I approve the request to reinstate
Anna Walentynowicz.

549
00:54:58,363 --> 00:55:00,398
Send a car for Walentynowicz.

550
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:04,776
This salary raise...

551
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,389
...2000 zloty?

552
00:55:07,272 --> 00:55:09,859
There's 16 thousand people working here.

553
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:14,875
You must know things are very serious.
All shipyards are on strike.

554
00:55:14,952 --> 00:55:17,909
I'm not authorized to... all right.

555
00:55:18,792 --> 00:55:21,380
This is how I see it.
I can't offer any more.

556
00:55:23,285 --> 00:55:25,432
And I see there's nothing to look at.

557
00:55:38,184 --> 00:55:39,837
Yes. 2000.

558
00:55:41,794 --> 00:55:43,989
Yes, I realize it's a lot.

559
00:55:48,514 --> 00:55:50,499
I guarantee it will solve the problem.

560
00:55:56,731 --> 00:55:58,267
What's going on?

561
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:06,388
This tram stops here.
We're joining the strike.

562
00:56:10,363 --> 00:56:12,398
A plaque instead of the monument.

563
00:56:15,893 --> 00:56:18,235
Inform the headquarters.

564
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,058
Call Wałęsa.

565
00:56:36,706 --> 00:56:38,703
All our demands have been met.

566
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:44,649
Let me through!

567
00:56:44,923 --> 00:56:46,997
The strike is over!

568
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:55,474
You abandoned us!
We supported you.

569
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:59,156
All buses and trams in the city
are at a standstill.

570
00:56:59,246 --> 00:57:03,325
And now you say it's over?! They're
going to crush us all like vermin!

571
00:57:03,432 --> 00:57:05,128
You've betrayed us!

572
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:08,051
The whole city is on strike!

573
00:57:08,112 --> 00:57:10,378
- What do we do?
- We keep going.

574
00:57:11,918 --> 00:57:14,308
- We're still on strike.
- What do you mean?

575
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:19,361
- But you've agreed to everything.
- I was satisfied then - now I'm hungry.

576
00:57:20,405 --> 00:57:23,707
You can shoot us,
but you can't break our resolve.

577
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:26,127
Let Warsaw know what we said.

578
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:32,079
No pay rise for those of you
who are still here after 6 pm.

579
00:57:32,194 --> 00:57:34,767
We got what we came here for, but...

580
00:57:39,797 --> 00:57:47,208
I announce a strike of solidarity.
We're staying put!

581
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:51,043
Don't go away…stay here!

582
00:58:01,224 --> 00:58:06,101
It's not over yet! We're still on strike!
People, stop! Come back! It's not over!

583
00:58:24,944 --> 00:58:26,345
Close the gate!

584
00:58:45,845 --> 00:58:47,803
ZOMO is here. Militarized Militia.

585
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:56,862
It's Sunday.

586
00:58:57,211 --> 00:58:59,113
There's no one in the shipyard.

587
00:58:59,174 --> 00:59:01,829
People went home,
to their families, to church.

588
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,774
And ZOMO is at the gate.
They can get in.

589
00:59:09,998 --> 00:59:11,995
Bring people back.

590
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:15,643
How? By force?

591
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:21,611
We were told the tanks are coming.
They're bringing in the military.

592
00:59:21,672 --> 00:59:24,492
They've set up an extra post for ZOMO
at the local army barracks.

593
00:59:24,552 --> 00:59:25,435
They'll kill us all.

594
00:59:25,512 --> 00:59:29,944
- Let them. There's no going back now!
- I knew we should have taken the money.

595
00:59:30,005 --> 00:59:33,986
I don't give a shit about the 2000 zloty.
You want to be a Soviet slave?

596
00:59:34,229 --> 00:59:38,530
You're asking for trouble, man.
My kids need food on the table...

597
00:59:38,591 --> 00:59:40,216
and they need their father.

598
00:59:44,866 --> 00:59:48,210
- I don't want to get killed.
- And I just want to be free.

599
00:59:48,271 --> 00:59:51,113
You get shit if you ask for too much.

600
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:58,229
Get yourselves ready!
We're moving in!

601
01:00:06,485 --> 01:00:07,975
ZOMO is all set.

602
01:00:16,968 --> 01:00:19,959
Let's organize a Holy Mass
to bring back the people.

603
01:00:20,808 --> 01:00:24,955
...give us this day our daily bread,

604
01:00:25,032 --> 01:00:27,583
and forgive us our trespasses,

605
01:00:27,643 --> 01:00:30,907
as we forgive those who
trespass against us...

606
01:01:14,645 --> 01:01:16,565
STRIKE DEMANDS

607
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:42,391
Have you gone mad?

608
01:01:45,288 --> 01:01:47,460
You want them to shoot us all?

609
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:50,971
- What do you mean?
- A demand for free elections?

610
01:01:53,928 --> 01:01:57,346
They'll go along with no censorship
even if it's a false promise.

611
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:58,768
They've accepted the pay rises.

612
01:01:58,829 --> 01:02:02,554
- And free trade unions?
- They wouldn't call them 'free'.

613
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:04,965
Maybe slave trade unions then?

614
01:02:05,026 --> 01:02:08,927
We need to come up with a name
they don't find some fault with.

615
01:02:10,747 --> 01:02:12,178
Make me some coffee.

616
01:02:31,483 --> 01:02:33,557
I've brought some bread.

617
01:02:45,691 --> 01:02:49,723
Lech, militia cars outside the shipyard.

618
01:02:50,837 --> 01:02:53,591
They will get in.
I told you from the start.

619
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:58,171
- They only want to scare us.
- Or they're getting ready.

620
01:02:58,363 --> 01:03:02,702
- Still no government delegation.
- Who are you afraid of?

621
01:03:03,086 --> 01:03:05,582
- The forces of law and order.
- They're scared, too.

622
01:03:05,659 --> 01:03:09,537
- I wonder who they're scared of.
- Of their minister.

623
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:12,302
- And the minister?
- Of Gierek.

624
01:03:12,431 --> 01:03:14,424
- And Gierek?
- Of Brezhnev and Moscow.

625
01:03:14,485 --> 01:03:18,517
- And Brezhnev? Of Americans?
- Americans make him laugh.

626
01:03:20,021 --> 01:03:21,864
Isn't he afraid of God?

627
01:03:21,979 --> 01:03:25,341
He's an atheist. Russians
are not even afraid of the devil.

628
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:28,431
Relax.
They want to see how long we last.

629
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,925
What does it mean to be a leader?

630
01:03:34,421 --> 01:03:37,992
It means being determined.
Inside and out.

631
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:40,657
I've always been like this.

632
01:03:40,718 --> 01:03:44,436
Even when I was a poor farm boy
who dreamed of being a pilot.

633
01:03:45,134 --> 01:03:49,128
I was always the pack leader.
Like a bull leading a herd.

634
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:51,777
Watching out for it.

635
01:03:51,893 --> 01:03:55,349
Without a bull, cows scatter
looking for a bit of grass.

636
01:03:57,806 --> 01:04:02,376
Herd without a leader
is a thing with no future.

637
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:07,176
Although I'm not sure if I'm a leader.

638
01:04:08,443 --> 01:04:11,477
All I know is that I have a gut feeling.

639
01:04:12,552 --> 01:04:17,023
And when the crowd falls silent,
I know what I want to say

640
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:18,994
and I can choose the right words.

641
01:04:25,877 --> 01:04:30,255
As always, I'd like to say hello
and give you the latest news.

642
01:04:31,253 --> 01:04:34,080
Nothing has changed since
yesterday evening.

643
01:04:34,248 --> 01:04:35,842
So, we're still waiting.

644
01:04:36,014 --> 01:04:41,390
You've got to help us out,
the people on this side are very tired.

645
01:04:41,813 --> 01:04:46,690
Please give us your support,
because if we give up now,

646
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,148
we won't be able to solve
this issue for a long time.

647
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:55,636
Two professors from Warsaw
are at the gate.

648
01:04:55,714 --> 01:04:58,568
They've brought a letter.
Signed by intellectuals.

649
01:04:58,824 --> 01:05:00,898
- So what?
- Should we let them in?

650
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:03,309
- Who are they?
- Geremek and Mazowiecki.

651
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:06,713
They're all right.
They wrote letters of support...

652
01:05:06,773 --> 01:05:10,519
...for the persecuted workers
and risked being abused themselves.

653
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:13,992
What do we need them for?

654
01:05:15,182 --> 01:05:17,179
For advice. On different things.

655
01:05:20,597 --> 01:05:21,850
Experts?

656
01:05:23,938 --> 01:05:25,935
OK, go get them. Might be useful.

657
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:55,958
Look, there's nothing about us here.
Work stoppages.

658
01:05:56,113 --> 01:05:58,417
It's the censorship.

659
01:05:59,995 --> 01:06:02,062
We need to get the
foreign press involved.

660
01:06:02,123 --> 01:06:04,312
Where would we get them from?

661
01:06:04,373 --> 01:06:05,909
Here, Sopot.

662
01:06:05,986 --> 01:06:09,634
- Where in Sopot?
- The international music festival.

663
01:06:10,517 --> 01:06:12,821
- Go get them then.
- Me? Let him do it.

664
01:06:12,974 --> 01:06:15,393
He doesn't speak English.
Go!

665
01:06:38,856 --> 01:06:42,245
I welcome the Prime Minister
and the government delegation

666
01:06:42,337 --> 01:06:45,755
on behalf of the Inter-Enterprise
Strike Committee,

667
01:06:46,152 --> 01:06:51,605
which represents 370 industrial plants
and factories.

668
01:06:52,219 --> 01:06:56,558
Our country is currently facing
a difficult economic situation.

669
01:06:56,789 --> 01:07:03,163
The reason is that the workers
have not been properly represented.

670
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:07,004
We're fighting for our own trade union.

671
01:07:07,618 --> 01:07:10,921
We have a right to one.
Just like our other rights.

672
01:07:11,074 --> 01:07:14,262
And who are those gentlemen over there?
Are they Polish citizens?

673
01:07:14,338 --> 01:07:19,484
It's unprecedented to hold negotiations
on national issues

674
01:07:19,637 --> 01:07:23,170
attended by representatives
of the foreign press.

675
01:07:23,285 --> 01:07:26,856
We are talking about our country,
about Poland.

676
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:30,968
If they're not accredited
Polish journalists...

677
01:07:31,733 --> 01:07:33,615
Please leave the room, thank you.

678
01:07:34,306 --> 01:07:36,896
I've presented the
commission's detailed views

679
01:07:36,957 --> 01:07:39,601
on the 21 demands of the workers.

680
01:07:39,858 --> 01:07:43,045
As for us, we're all set
and we won't back down.

681
01:07:43,106 --> 01:07:46,293
We simply want a decent life
for everyone.

682
01:07:47,528 --> 01:07:50,564
And now Andrzej Gwiazda will present
our perspective on trade unions.

683
01:07:50,626 --> 01:07:59,266
A free independent trade union will
protect social and material interests

684
01:07:59,573 --> 01:08:02,530
of employees
and will not act as a political party.

685
01:08:03,106 --> 01:08:06,677
We have received the following message:

686
01:08:07,571 --> 01:08:12,206
Miners from coal mines in Silesia

687
01:08:12,782 --> 01:08:16,645
have started a strike of solidarity
with the workers from Gdansk.

688
01:08:18,734 --> 01:08:23,112
Miners from Silesia send their greetings
to the shipyard workers.

689
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,869
The following coal
mines are on strike...

690
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:35,938
Manifest Lipcowy, Borynia, Jastrzębie...

691
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:00,435
Now we've got them!

692
01:09:00,898 --> 01:09:02,549
Lech is coming!

693
01:09:04,661 --> 01:09:07,474
- What are you counting on now?
- An earthquake.

694
01:09:08,368 --> 01:09:10,058
You think it's likely?

695
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:12,116
I always think what I say.

696
01:09:12,176 --> 01:09:15,252
You are at the driving wheel here.
Aren't you afraid of losing control?

697
01:09:15,313 --> 01:09:16,772
I won't lose control.

698
01:09:16,834 --> 01:09:20,676
Let's all behave like decent people,
and everything will be alright.

699
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:29,429
The right to strike will be guaranteed
in a new regulation about trade unions.

700
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:36,341
I propose we prepare a press release
stating that we have reached consensus,

701
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:39,455
that the strike is over
and that work will continue.

702
01:09:39,515 --> 01:09:43,752
Prime Minister, we're almost done,
we'll go through what's left in a flash.

703
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:46,993
So I suggest... since we have been
waiting for so long...

704
01:09:47,054 --> 01:09:50,304
It's Saturday. Let's keep on
working through Sunday...

705
01:09:50,365 --> 01:09:58,346
to have the agreement ready by Monday.
This is too important to act in a hurry.

706
01:10:00,341 --> 01:10:04,565
We want to go back to work on Monday.

707
01:10:04,757 --> 01:10:08,213
But we have to get it guaranteed
in black and white.

708
01:10:08,273 --> 01:10:11,532
- You will have it in writing.
- "Will have it" isn't the same as having it.

709
01:10:11,592 --> 01:10:16,621
- But we have signed some things...
- Yes, Prime Minister.

710
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,501
That's why I think we're halfway there.

711
01:10:20,562 --> 01:10:22,405
But since we have those signatures...

712
01:10:22,466 --> 01:10:26,837
Of course, but there are still many
unresolved issues.

713
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:30,869
I have one more proposal to discuss.

714
01:10:32,684 --> 01:10:36,410
As we're really making progress here,

715
01:10:36,898 --> 01:10:41,237
I ask that you do something to stop
the arrests of opposition activists.

716
01:10:41,813 --> 01:10:45,883
Mainly in Warsaw, where many
KOR members have been imprisoned.

717
01:10:46,114 --> 01:10:48,807
I propose we sign a draft
of this press release.

718
01:10:48,885 --> 01:10:51,298
I propose that we stop here.

719
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:57,672
But please bear in mind
the issue of those arrests.

720
01:10:58,136 --> 01:11:00,415
We've established a good
working relationship.

721
01:11:00,476 --> 01:11:04,514
The arrests are the only thing that stops
us from closing the deal by Monday.

722
01:11:18,264 --> 01:11:21,183
GDAŃSK
31 AUGUST, 1980

723
01:11:58,574 --> 01:12:01,987
Lech, Lech, Lech!

724
01:12:14,933 --> 01:12:19,541
We now have independent
trade unions.

725
01:12:21,077 --> 01:12:22,996
We have the right to strike.

726
01:12:24,072 --> 01:12:27,374
And other rights
will be established soon.

727
01:12:36,629 --> 01:12:39,624
Intercollegiate Strike Committee
Demands

728
01:12:40,568 --> 01:12:43,749
Please remember the people
on this side are really tired.

729
01:12:43,809 --> 01:12:48,610
They want to go home - which I know
will probably boost birth statistics...

730
01:12:49,877 --> 01:12:51,719
What about the prisoners?

731
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:58,362
All of them are getting out.
I have it all on in writing here.

732
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:06,844
We have been fighting together
and I haven't thanked you properly.

733
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:12,072
It hasn't been my fight only.
You have fought, too.

734
01:13:12,302 --> 01:13:15,297
So, let me thank you,

735
01:13:15,413 --> 01:13:19,829
go home now, get some rest, let us
take care of the final arrangements.

736
01:13:46,978 --> 01:13:48,975
Good morning, we're a bit early.

737
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:51,508
- Good morning.
- It's six forty.

738
01:13:51,701 --> 01:13:53,237
Please come in.

739
01:14:03,374 --> 01:14:06,791
Is this the first time a TV crew
interviews you in bed?

740
01:14:06,946 --> 01:14:09,404
In bed? It's the first time for sure.

741
01:14:17,698 --> 01:14:20,939
What do you think about all this?
Your husband is pretty much a guest here.

742
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,361
He is.

743
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:26,659
How do you cope with that?
How many children do you have?

744
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,102
We have six kids.

745
01:14:28,258 --> 01:14:30,677
- How old is the oldest?
- 10.

746
01:14:30,869 --> 01:14:32,904
- And the youngest?
- Two months old.

747
01:14:33,173 --> 01:14:35,170
- A baby.
- Right.

748
01:14:36,744 --> 01:14:38,741
Do the neighbors help you out?

749
01:14:38,818 --> 01:14:45,154
In this part of the building, there are
no neighbors. Only offices.

750
01:14:46,037 --> 01:14:48,187
I don't have time
for neighbors anyway.

751
01:14:48,248 --> 01:14:51,243
You say you're tired,
but I see a smiling face.

752
01:14:52,181 --> 01:14:54,178
I need to cope somehow.

753
01:14:54,754 --> 01:14:59,404
What if this situation lasts longer?
And your husband keeps being only a guest?

754
01:15:00,754 --> 01:15:02,915
- I don't know...
- Will you protest?

755
01:15:04,814 --> 01:15:06,849
For sure.

756
01:15:07,809 --> 01:15:10,941
I feel more and more tired,
and I can hardly manage.

757
01:15:11,074 --> 01:15:13,618
But your husband is fighting
for great things.

758
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:17,065
A family is a great thing, too.

759
01:15:17,909 --> 01:15:19,061
Don't you think so?

760
01:15:19,244 --> 01:15:21,898
Is it not possible to combine
these two great things?

761
01:15:21,959 --> 01:15:29,007
Maybe, but I don't know...
We might find a way. I'm sure we will.

762
01:15:30,005 --> 01:15:33,538
- Thank you very much. Sorry.
- Good bye.

763
01:15:37,493 --> 01:15:43,138
What have you done?
Look at all that cream!

764
01:15:45,422 --> 01:15:47,803
How long will Wałęsa last?

765
01:15:50,126 --> 01:15:52,929
If they don't kill me,
if it all works out...

766
01:15:54,657 --> 01:15:56,386
You want a cold calculation?

767
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:03,182
I can say that from now on
It's a downward slope for me.

768
01:16:04,066 --> 01:16:06,370
Gentle or maybe steep.
I'll explain why.

769
01:16:07,483 --> 01:16:13,166
I wasn't made for peaceful times
and I can't play by everyday rules.

770
01:16:13,934 --> 01:16:18,120
I can't repeat what I did before.
In 1980 and later.

771
01:16:18,773 --> 01:16:25,032
If something goes wrong in Poland,
people will focus their anger on me.

772
01:16:25,646 --> 01:16:31,252
And the people who praise me now
will start throwing stones.

773
01:16:31,906 --> 01:16:35,938
They will forget I was on their side.
Fighting their fight.

774
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:43,433
If I was greedy, I'd shave off my mustache
and go back to work in the shipyard.

775
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:47,005
But I won't do it as long as
'Solidarity' still wants me.

776
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:53,218
I know that from now on
the situation will only become harder.

777
01:16:53,794 --> 01:16:56,789
Things will get more complicated.

778
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:59,360
Eat some sandwiches.
They're over there.

779
01:17:01,243 --> 01:17:03,842
The government hasn't kept
its promises.

780
01:17:03,969 --> 01:17:07,210
We seem to be playing both
chess and checkers on one board.

781
01:17:07,272 --> 01:17:13,378
But it's time to play one game now,
and discuss the future of the nation.

782
01:17:13,646 --> 01:17:15,643
What about wildcat strikes?

783
01:17:15,989 --> 01:17:19,559
Let me eat, gentlemen.
Help yourselves.

784
01:17:20,098 --> 01:17:24,744
They started a strike in central Poland.
Do we support it?

785
01:17:25,858 --> 01:17:29,505
I'm not authorizing anything.
Not reading or signing anything.

786
01:17:30,581 --> 01:17:34,748
Tell them we're sorry for their trouble.
Tell them to go back to work.

787
01:17:36,725 --> 01:17:41,786
We've made you the boss and you back down?
This is bullshit, not a free trade union.

788
01:17:42,523 --> 01:17:46,571
- Are you not authorizing the strike?
- This is what the situation demands.

789
01:17:46,632 --> 01:17:49,605
What we need to do is hit them hard.
And not back down.

790
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:54,038
No more talking to the communists.

791
01:17:54,734 --> 01:17:57,954
Who should I talk to then?
You? We've talked enough.

792
01:17:58,308 --> 01:17:59,900
The Americans don't want to talk.

793
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:02,495
What would you have me do?

794
01:18:03,029 --> 01:18:05,656
- I'm the one risking everything.
- What about my leg?

795
01:18:05,717 --> 01:18:07,483
Let them give it back to me!

796
01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:11,170
Half a million troops,
100,000 militia men.

797
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:16,277
You've convinced me. Take your crutches.
Let's go arrest Brezhnev.

798
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:20,693
- May I have more scrambled eggs?
- You like them?

799
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:24,629
- Sure! Your wife makes great eggs.
- Danuta, could you fix some more?

800
01:18:30,869 --> 01:18:33,480
What else?
This is not a way to live.

801
01:18:33,826 --> 01:18:37,666
The door is open day and night.
People go in and out.

802
01:18:38,894 --> 01:18:40,852
Good bye, thank you for coming.

803
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:43,809
Look at the time, gentlemen.
Go on. Good bye.

804
01:18:43,963 --> 01:18:45,986
People coming in like
they own the place!

805
01:18:46,047 --> 01:18:50,606
The neighbor picks Wałęsa over the cops
when her drunk husband misbehaves.

806
01:18:50,837 --> 01:18:54,485
Lech! You have your own family.
You have kids. Remember?

807
01:18:55,675 --> 01:18:58,581
Bogdan was sent to the principal's office.
He tried to start a strike at school.

808
01:18:58,605 --> 01:19:01,715
The other morning, everyone's in pajamas
and there's a camera crew filming!

809
01:19:01,776 --> 01:19:03,773
Have you no shame?

810
01:19:04,737 --> 01:19:07,541
Good bye. Get out of here!

811
01:19:10,421 --> 01:19:11,554
You too!

812
01:20:20,117 --> 01:20:22,770
If you want, I can stick it
on the door.

813
01:20:22,831 --> 01:20:24,443
TYPHUS
NO ENTRY

814
01:20:40,376 --> 01:20:41,697
STRIKE

815
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:55,484
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

816
01:20:58,056 --> 01:21:00,335
This is Channel One
of the Polish Radio

817
01:21:00,514 --> 01:21:04,639
Lech Wałęsa, with the approval
of "Solidarity" and the government,

818
01:21:04,699 --> 01:21:07,987
has decided to call off
the general strike...

819
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,014
Turn it off.

820
01:21:10,075 --> 01:21:14,357
This is what the union has come to.
He's basically become a king.

821
01:21:14,653 --> 01:21:18,046
He didn't say he'd break the strike.
But that he might do it.

822
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:28,562
That he would be held accountable
and would resign if necessary...

823
01:21:28,879 --> 01:21:31,324
We can assume he's going to
break the strike,

824
01:21:31,385 --> 01:21:33,248
Some of the demands will be met.

825
01:21:33,309 --> 01:21:36,916
He'll be the one to save the day.

826
01:21:37,378 --> 01:21:44,827
We now need to decide if the union
should be run by the will of one man

827
01:21:45,173 --> 01:21:47,477
or led by a collective body.

828
01:21:48,629 --> 01:21:53,505
At this point I want to say
we have come up with a good compromise.

829
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:58,075
Maybe nothing would have happened
but the risk was too high to take.

830
01:21:58,843 --> 01:22:06,638
I don't regret what I have done
even if everyone else disagreed.

831
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:12,168
Because I know that courage
is nothing without sound judgment.

832
01:22:12,936 --> 01:22:18,312
And I know we've achieved a lot.
I know one thing: people's reactions

833
01:22:19,157 --> 01:22:22,344
when we left the negotiations.
They fell into each other's arms.

834
01:22:22,421 --> 01:22:25,416
They lifted my car up in joy.
Didn't you see that?!

835
01:22:25,684 --> 01:22:27,227
- I did.
- Exactly.

836
01:22:28,183 --> 01:22:30,986
What does the nation want?
Who do you represent?

837
01:22:31,175 --> 01:22:32,712
Who do you want to expose?

838
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:36,053
As long as I'm here,

839
01:22:37,858 --> 01:22:39,855
I will use all viable options.

840
01:22:40,277 --> 01:22:42,773
I can expose myself,
but not the people.

841
01:22:45,946 --> 01:22:49,094
Where did you learn to think this way?

842
01:22:49,186 --> 01:22:51,629
I don't know.
I've never really read books.

843
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:54,830
I try but I get bored
by the time I reach page 5.

844
01:22:56,366 --> 01:23:00,840
I've always solved my own problems.
Even repaired my own washing machines.

845
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:05,353
Lech, what about the intellectuals?

846
01:23:05,415 --> 01:23:08,103
God save us from intellectuals
and peasants!

847
01:23:08,923 --> 01:23:10,958
Now you will probably ask

848
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:14,912
why I keep all those professors,
advisers and experts around me.

849
01:23:15,182 --> 01:23:19,675
I know if I tried to keep them away
they'd still find a way back in.

850
01:23:23,554 --> 01:23:25,973
So I've chosen to engage them.

851
01:23:27,048 --> 01:23:31,349
It's also convenient to have
intelligent people around.

852
01:23:32,923 --> 01:23:34,898
There's one thing to keep in mind.

853
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:40,103
You shouldn't feel inferior to them.
And I don't. You know why?

854
01:23:42,869 --> 01:23:48,398
They talk and talk for hours and
their conclusions are the same

855
01:23:48,706 --> 01:23:51,240
as the ones I reach in five seconds.

856
01:23:54,043 --> 01:23:56,501
I'm not too cocky, am I?

857
01:23:58,344 --> 01:23:59,995
Not at all. Why?

858
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:03,413
I can make that impression.

859
01:24:04,987 --> 01:24:08,136
Is it true you removed your chador
in front of Khomeini?

860
01:24:09,518 --> 01:24:11,514
It's true, I did.

861
01:24:14,587 --> 01:24:18,734
Aren't you afraid of Russian tanks?
And if not Russian, then Polish ones?

862
01:24:20,654 --> 01:24:22,242
No, no, no.

863
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:25,407
I don't want to think about this.

864
01:24:26,146 --> 01:24:28,540
Why are you saying such horrid things?

865
01:24:30,638 --> 01:24:32,992
There will be no Soviet tanks.

866
01:24:34,939 --> 01:24:36,514
No Soviet tanks.

867
01:24:44,053 --> 01:24:46,541
13 DECEMBER, 1981

868
01:24:53,294 --> 01:24:55,291
The Secretary and the Governor.

869
01:25:02,971 --> 01:25:04,968
I was expecting this.

870
01:25:05,582 --> 01:25:07,987
This is the last nail in your coffin.

871
01:25:11,611 --> 01:25:13,608
We were ordered to take...

872
01:25:14,837 --> 01:25:17,335
to invite you for a friendly chat.

873
01:25:19,867 --> 01:25:22,901
Good evening, Danuta,
we apologize...

874
01:25:23,477 --> 01:25:25,474
They've introduced martial law.

875
01:25:26,741 --> 01:25:29,736
We're taking your husband to Warsaw.

876
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:39,805
I'm not going anywhere.
If you release other prisoners, I'll go.

877
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:44,266
Good night, gentlemen.

878
01:25:57,653 --> 01:26:00,456
- So it's happened.
- What now?

879
01:26:00,648 --> 01:26:02,356
They'll be back.

880
01:26:04,334 --> 01:26:07,714
I've packed some stuff just in case.

881
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:13,501
Open the door! Now!
Or we'll break it down!

882
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,907
Break it down then!
I won't open it.

883
01:26:17,813 --> 01:26:20,654
Bring the other two back
and I'll open the door.

884
01:26:23,255 --> 01:26:25,909
Danuta, don't get scared,
but it could take up to a year.

885
01:26:25,969 --> 01:26:27,782
I'm not scared at all.

886
01:26:32,213 --> 01:26:33,213
Lech,

887
01:26:35,054 --> 01:26:37,320
what if I did get scared?

888
01:26:37,973 --> 01:26:42,575
If you got scared, it would be the end
for me, for the kids, for everyone.

889
01:26:42,785 --> 01:26:44,129
I'm not scared, then.

890
01:26:46,651 --> 01:26:47,897
Not at all.

891
01:26:51,221 --> 01:26:54,216
- I'm scared, too.
- I know.

892
01:26:59,746 --> 01:27:01,128
Open the door, Lech.

893
01:27:02,814 --> 01:27:05,309
Danuta, open up. Wake up the kids.

894
01:27:05,966 --> 01:27:09,346
Let them see the communists
take their father away.

895
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:16,268
- May we come in?
- You've got a great sense of humour.

896
01:27:27,085 --> 01:27:31,026
Don't any of you catch cold.
Mom can't handle your being sick.

897
01:27:31,963 --> 01:27:35,035
Bogdan, don't get sick again.
Remember!

898
01:27:35,688 --> 01:27:37,684
Where are you going, dad?

899
01:27:39,998 --> 01:27:41,460
I'll be back.

900
01:27:53,237 --> 01:27:55,234
Danuta, please...

901
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:03,719
One thing, Danuta...

902
01:28:04,142 --> 01:28:06,212
People will turn away from you.

903
01:28:06,407 --> 01:28:10,010
- What are you talking about?
- They will. They're just people.

904
01:28:35,093 --> 01:28:36,093
After you.

905
01:28:39,278 --> 01:28:41,919
One day you'll come begging for a job.

906
01:28:51,431 --> 01:28:56,077
Citizens of the People's
Republic of Poland!

907
01:28:56,635 --> 01:28:58,632
Today I address you

908
01:28:58,978 --> 01:29:02,357
as a soldier and as the head
of the Polish government.

909
01:29:02,971 --> 01:29:05,736
Our homeland is
on the verge of collapse.

910
01:29:06,965 --> 01:29:09,976
Our administrative structures
are no longer effective.

911
01:29:10,138 --> 01:29:14,208
The collapsing economy
is being dealt blow after blow.

912
01:29:16,669 --> 01:29:18,477
Our soldiers' hands are clean.

913
01:29:18,755 --> 01:29:21,257
Our goal is the best
interest of the nation.

914
01:29:21,318 --> 01:29:25,702
The army won't replace
regular socialist democracy.

915
01:29:26,411 --> 01:29:30,189
Anarchy is the enemy of democracy.

916
01:29:30,903 --> 01:29:33,093
We want Poland to be a great country.

917
01:29:33,154 --> 01:29:37,339
Great in terms of culture,
heritage, its position in Europe.

918
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:43,315
The only way to reach this goal is though
socialism, accepted by the whole Nation.

919
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:46,739
Poland has not yet perished,
so long as we still live.

920
01:29:51,278 --> 01:29:55,284
What if I shouted I was Lech Wałęsa,
and you've taken me hostage?

921
01:29:57,422 --> 01:29:58,486
Go ahead.

922
01:29:59,803 --> 01:30:01,378
Inspection.

923
01:30:01,608 --> 01:30:05,563
People! I'm Lech Wałęsa.
I've been kidnapped by the communists!

924
01:30:06,062 --> 01:30:09,036
You son of a bitch!
It's all your fault!

925
01:30:09,097 --> 01:30:10,594
Get out of the car!

926
01:30:10,709 --> 01:30:12,398
Fuck off, you bastard!

927
01:30:19,003 --> 01:30:20,577
Still want to get out?

928
01:30:21,653 --> 01:30:25,339
You see, Lech.
Poles are not an easy nation to rule.

929
01:30:36,808 --> 01:30:39,600
ARŁAMÓW
11 MAY, 1982

930
01:30:52,334 --> 01:30:54,331
- Where are we?
- The East.

931
01:30:56,136 --> 01:30:57,775
Confirm the delivery.

932
01:31:02,472 --> 01:31:05,116
- Russian or ours?
- Russian, goddamn it.

933
01:31:05,314 --> 01:31:09,290
Shit. If they take him out,
they take us out. No witnesses. Let's go.

934
01:31:56,347 --> 01:31:58,996
Mr. Wałęsa.
You're finished.

935
01:31:59,304 --> 01:32:02,476
All your buddies are either
in jail or on our side.

936
01:32:02,537 --> 01:32:04,779
Or they're shitting themselves.

937
01:32:05,755 --> 01:32:10,286
The politburo doesn't want to talk to you.
You are a nobody, they say.

938
01:32:11,554 --> 01:32:13,896
Just a regular scoundrel.

939
01:32:14,894 --> 01:32:18,523
They're considering what I call
the model from Czechoslovakia:

940
01:32:18,585 --> 01:32:22,188
tanks stay in the country,
you stay in prison. For 18 years.

941
01:32:24,571 --> 01:32:27,130
But I'd like to give you
one last chance.

942
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:31,393
- You will go on TV and stop the strikes.
- Oh, so there are strikes?

943
01:32:31,454 --> 01:32:35,411
- You'll apologize for 'Solidarity'.
- I demand to see my advisers.

944
01:32:45,574 --> 01:32:50,643
Did you know that our friends
in the East are wondering

945
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:54,650
if there's any reason to keep you alive?

946
01:32:55,637 --> 01:32:58,016
Kill me, and people
will make me a saint.

947
01:33:03,735 --> 01:33:06,623
It's gloomy in here.
Please join me, gentlemen.

948
01:33:08,451 --> 01:33:10,599
The more the merrier. Come on.

949
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:19,387
Do you have a wife and kids?

950
01:33:19,982 --> 01:33:21,978
No, I'm single.

951
01:33:33,768 --> 01:33:37,710
If you're poisoned, it will be
a smaller loss for Poland. Enjoy.

952
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:54,541
Martial law has stopped those
rushing headlong into a civil war.

953
01:33:55,157 --> 01:33:57,822
The 13th of December
was a shock for everyone.

954
01:33:58,023 --> 01:34:01,094
But it certainly prevented
something far worse.

955
01:34:04,516 --> 01:34:07,762
Most people greeted that day
with understanding and relief.

956
01:34:07,823 --> 01:34:12,507
There is hope again for rebuilding
our deregulated economy.

957
01:34:16,737 --> 01:34:22,920
Some people never learned
their lessons from history.

958
01:34:55,175 --> 01:34:58,469
This is Radio Free Europe,
the voice of free Poland.

959
01:34:58,632 --> 01:34:59,822
Listen!

960
01:35:00,654 --> 01:35:03,985
Solidarity has organized rallies
in all major Polish cities.

961
01:35:04,046 --> 01:35:08,387
The authorities ordered a brutal
suppression of all demonstrations by ZOMO.

962
01:35:08,448 --> 01:35:11,589
Tear gas, water cannons, and
armored vehicles were used.

963
01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:13,422
...many have been wounded...

964
01:35:18,101 --> 01:35:21,518
Mr. Wałęsa!

965
01:35:24,091 --> 01:35:27,270
- Why exactly am I interned?
- What are you talking about?

966
01:35:27,355 --> 01:35:29,505
You are not an internee.

967
01:35:29,736 --> 01:35:32,750
- What am I then?
- You are the government's guest.

968
01:35:33,422 --> 01:35:36,916
- Officially.
- So I can leave. Good bye then.

969
01:35:43,559 --> 01:35:44,981
You will go on TV.

970
01:35:45,288 --> 01:35:48,754
You'll condemn the strikes,
apologize for 'Solidarity'

971
01:35:49,474 --> 01:35:54,696
and agree to join the executive
board of a NEW trade union.

972
01:35:54,773 --> 01:35:56,770
- What if I don't?
- What?

973
01:35:58,071 --> 01:35:59,210
What if I don't?

974
01:36:00,531 --> 01:36:02,182
That's not an option.

975
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:08,246
You have the key to your own freedom.

976
01:36:16,968 --> 01:36:18,602
Yes or no?

977
01:36:20,654 --> 01:36:22,281
Yes or no?

978
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:30,587
- You're not a good politician.
- I'm just an electrician.

979
01:36:42,273 --> 01:36:43,387
Good bye.

980
01:37:10,423 --> 01:37:14,916
- Is it going to be a portable altar?
- A field altar, my son.

981
01:37:16,027 --> 01:37:18,632
Will you take part in the Mass, boys?

982
01:37:18,715 --> 01:37:21,787
We don't have time.
We need to keep an eye on you.

983
01:37:34,805 --> 01:37:37,580
- Praised be Jesus Christ.
- Forever and ever.

984
01:37:40,103 --> 01:37:42,331
I'm afraid this is my last visit.

985
01:37:43,076 --> 01:37:44,576
They want to punish you this way.

986
01:37:44,637 --> 01:37:47,900
They see your advisers
and react like the devil to holy water.

987
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:52,454
They want to cut you off
from everybody. I beg you, son,

988
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:56,654
think about writing to our leader,
General Jaruzelski,

989
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:00,552
ask him to let you out.
The Polish nation needs you.

990
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:04,044
I didn't ask him to lock me up,
I will not ask him to set me free.

991
01:38:04,103 --> 01:38:05,350
There's no shame in it.

992
01:38:05,410 --> 01:38:07,499
Even the Pope has sent
a letter to the general.

993
01:38:07,559 --> 01:38:09,094
No, no, no!

994
01:38:10,666 --> 01:38:12,707
But the general didn't answer.

995
01:38:14,856 --> 01:38:15,969
A letter from Danuta.

996
01:38:23,995 --> 01:38:26,456
I have the Pope's Encyclical for you.

997
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:30,293
- You should read it.
- No need.

998
01:38:30,407 --> 01:38:32,878
I agree with everything the Pope says.

999
01:38:34,709 --> 01:38:39,662
I'm afraid I have to show you this,
as much as it pains me.

1000
01:38:43,541 --> 01:38:46,529
Who is Lech Wałęsa?
He is a Security Service agent.

1001
01:38:46,690 --> 01:38:50,508
A pharisee and a scoundrel.
During the December 1970 riots,

1002
01:38:50,568 --> 01:38:54,062
he informed on his colleagues,
including Anna Walentynowicz.

1003
01:38:57,672 --> 01:39:02,434
His master stroke was laying
the foundations for martial law.

1004
01:39:10,306 --> 01:39:15,413
Easy, son. This announcement,
supposedly written by 'Solidarity',

1005
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:18,885
is really distributed
by the Security Service.

1006
01:39:18,946 --> 01:39:22,010
They even delivered this
to the Norwegian embassy.

1007
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,983
Brezhnev, the Leader
of the Soviet Union is Dead

1008
01:40:18,005 --> 01:40:21,154
Lech Wałęsa Released From Internment

1009
01:40:29,102 --> 01:40:30,315
Dad's coming back.

1010
01:40:33,978 --> 01:40:35,639
They've released him!

1011
01:40:41,544 --> 01:40:42,939
The streets are empty.

1012
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,554
It's 3 in the morning.
People need to sleep before work.

1013
01:40:45,614 --> 01:40:48,503
I was supposed to pick you up
earlier, but there was no car.

1014
01:40:48,564 --> 01:40:52,020
Don't make me laugh.
I'm glad you didn't tell me to walk.

1015
01:40:55,368 --> 01:40:57,701
He's coming! He's coming!

1016
01:41:43,598 --> 01:41:45,155
He's mine now.

1017
01:41:57,998 --> 01:42:00,484
We'll stick a TYPHOID sign
on the door.

1018
01:42:01,186 --> 01:42:02,900
Come say hello to your dad!

1019
01:42:04,325 --> 01:42:07,572
You're all grown up! Come on!

1020
01:42:10,901 --> 01:42:14,089
TYPHOID
NO ENTRY

1021
01:42:19,809 --> 01:42:22,612
Solidarity! Solidarity!

1022
01:42:23,189 --> 01:42:25,186
Thank you for coming!

1023
01:42:28,871 --> 01:42:32,251
Thank you for always believing
in 'Solidarity'!

1024
01:42:32,789 --> 01:42:37,973
Solidarity! Solidarity!

1025
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:42,134
First objection:
why was I taken from my home?

1026
01:42:43,886 --> 01:42:47,419
- If you don't want to come to us...
- Then why am I here?

1027
01:42:48,302 --> 01:42:50,554
- How are you?
- How do you think I am?

1028
01:42:50,645 --> 01:42:52,680
- You're looking good.
- You too.

1029
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:57,480
There's news about you
coming from abroad.

1030
01:42:57,672 --> 01:42:58,824
What news exactly?

1031
01:42:58,901 --> 01:43:02,490
They talk about your meeting with
leaders of the clandestine 'Solidarity'.

1032
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:04,684
Give me the case number
and we'll talk.

1033
01:43:05,582 --> 01:43:08,686
- Did you meet them?
- I have the right to meet anyone I want.

1034
01:43:08,746 --> 01:43:10,744
But did you exercise this right?

1035
01:43:10,805 --> 01:43:15,049
- Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.
- Did this meeting take place or not?

1036
01:43:15,335 --> 01:43:17,617
There are 30 people watching me.

1037
01:43:18,139 --> 01:43:20,136
You should know my every move.

1038
01:43:21,134 --> 01:43:24,068
Did this meeting take place?
We want to know your opinion of it.

1039
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:25,913
Why was I taken from my home?

1040
01:43:26,105 --> 01:43:28,718
- I want specifics.
- Give me the case number.

1041
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:31,020
I'm not telling you if the meeting
took place.

1042
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,082
It would have been a good idea
for me to be there.

1043
01:43:33,143 --> 01:43:35,434
Then I will interrogate
you as a witness.

1044
01:43:35,496 --> 01:43:40,411
- You will answer my questions.
- I will or I won't. I'll decide.

1045
01:43:40,603 --> 01:43:43,954
- You're obligated to answer.
- I'll see if I'm obligated or not.

1046
01:43:44,014 --> 01:43:46,824
Did you inform foreign agencies
about the meeting

1047
01:43:46,885 --> 01:43:50,126
with the coordinators
of underground 'Solidarity'?

1048
01:43:50,357 --> 01:43:52,236
I will not answer this question.

1049
01:43:52,297 --> 01:43:56,339
Do you know of anyone else who
might have contacted foreign agencies?

1050
01:43:57,346 --> 01:43:59,585
I refuse to answer this question.

1051
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:03,259
As a free man, I can meet anyone
and do anything I please.

1052
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:06,637
I would argue that there's a limit
to doing as you please.

1053
01:44:06,715 --> 01:44:09,386
- You have nothing on me.
- Put it on the record:

1054
01:44:09,447 --> 01:44:12,093
- "That's all I have to say."
- Right!

1055
01:44:12,206 --> 01:44:15,469
End of report, date, time,
and so on...

1056
01:44:16,362 --> 01:44:18,254
Should I read it aloud
before you sign?

1057
01:44:18,315 --> 01:44:21,169
No, I will not sign it.
You didn't tell me

1058
01:44:21,230 --> 01:44:26,606
in what case I'm a witness.
This case is not about the meeting.

1059
01:44:26,798 --> 01:44:28,523
- It is.
- No, it's not.

1060
01:44:28,584 --> 01:44:31,240
That's how you see it.
I'm not going to argue with you.

1061
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:33,827
"After reading, I confirm
the report is consistent

1062
01:44:33,888 --> 01:44:35,032
with my testimony."

1063
01:44:35,093 --> 01:44:37,361
I also confirm I understand nothing.

1064
01:44:38,549 --> 01:44:43,809
I can add that you refuse to sign
the statement. What reason do I put down?

1065
01:44:44,117 --> 01:44:46,536
I don't sign anything.
That's my rule.

1066
01:45:13,454 --> 01:45:16,154
I won't believe it until
I hear it myself.

1067
01:45:20,327 --> 01:45:23,998
Nobel Committee has awarded
Nobel Peace Prize to Lech Wałęsa...

1068
01:45:26,472 --> 01:45:28,577
Congratulations!

1069
01:45:29,773 --> 01:45:35,321
The Nobel Committee has decided
to award Lech Wałęsa...

1070
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:37,992
Yes, we're very pleased.

1071
01:45:38,376 --> 01:45:43,116
...yet again supporting
a confrontational game

1072
01:45:43,175 --> 01:45:46,517
this time against Poland
and against socialism.

1073
01:45:47,707 --> 01:45:49,490
Tiny article. Small print.

1074
01:45:56,121 --> 01:46:00,046
Right. Let me hand him the phone.
Someone from the Norwegian embassy.

1075
01:46:02,338 --> 01:46:04,334
No, my decision is final.

1076
01:46:05,678 --> 01:46:09,714
I can't, because they won't let me
back into the country when I return.

1077
01:46:09,902 --> 01:46:12,552
Danuta will go.
That's my wife.

1078
01:46:15,278 --> 01:46:17,275
That's the best solution.

1079
01:46:17,450 --> 01:46:19,869
Thank you. Have a nice day, too.

1080
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:29,218
It'll be OK.

1081
01:46:34,966 --> 01:46:37,950
OSLO
10 DECEMBER, 1983

1082
01:46:39,469 --> 01:46:43,387
Your Majesty, Your Excellencies,

1083
01:46:44,155 --> 01:46:47,797
distinguished representatives
of the Norwegian Nation.

1084
01:46:53,947 --> 01:47:00,168
You know why I can't be here
to receive the honorable prize.

1085
01:47:07,693 --> 01:47:11,918
- Something to declare?
- The Nobel Prize and a medal.

1086
01:47:12,187 --> 01:47:16,373
- And my son's new skis.
- Money? Fur? Silver? Gold?

1087
01:47:18,023 --> 01:47:21,117
Are you looking for money?
I left everything in Oslo.

1088
01:47:21,686 --> 01:47:24,465
The chatty lady will go through
a personal inspection.

1089
01:47:24,526 --> 01:47:26,847
Halina?
Please follow my colleague.

1090
01:47:27,701 --> 01:47:29,698
Are you free? Let's go.

1091
01:47:33,230 --> 01:47:36,681
This is a personal inspection
according to the Polish customs law.

1092
01:47:36,742 --> 01:47:39,577
Do you have anything on you
that you haven't declared?

1093
01:47:39,639 --> 01:47:42,942
- No. Nothing.
- Empty your pockets.

1094
01:47:49,013 --> 01:47:51,010
Dad, when will Mom come?

1095
01:47:54,466 --> 01:47:55,712
In a minute.

1096
01:48:00,034 --> 01:48:03,029
- Is that it?
- Take off your underwear.

1097
01:48:21,269 --> 01:48:22,538
Panties.

1098
01:48:36,053 --> 01:48:37,541
Crouch please.

1099
01:48:43,886 --> 01:48:45,538
She's coming!

1100
01:48:45,768 --> 01:48:47,380
Mom's coming!

1101
01:48:49,915 --> 01:48:52,356
What took you so long?

1102
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:54,407
Personal inspection.

1103
01:48:58,746 --> 01:49:00,744
Lech, take the suitcase.

1104
01:49:05,005 --> 01:49:07,070
I thought we'd go
to Jasna Góra Sanctuary.

1105
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:10,905
We'll thank the Black Madonna,
leave the medal as a votive offering.

1106
01:49:15,835 --> 01:49:19,769
Why do you want me to tell you
all this? I have a headache.

1107
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:22,710
I do, too.

1108
01:49:23,263 --> 01:49:25,693
The nation is ready to blow up
like a bomb.

1109
01:49:25,754 --> 01:49:29,940
I know how to stop it.
The point is to go against the crowd.

1110
01:49:30,157 --> 01:49:31,387
Patiently.

1111
01:49:34,344 --> 01:49:38,798
Last question: you said, when
the communist government falls,

1112
01:49:39,067 --> 01:49:43,209
'Solidarity' will take over and you
should take control of everything.

1113
01:49:43,291 --> 01:49:45,058
Yes, I did say that.

1114
01:49:45,165 --> 01:49:49,197
So you were not joking.
Do you think you're capable of that?

1115
01:49:49,627 --> 01:49:50,862
Yes, I believe I am.

1116
01:49:52,687 --> 01:49:59,460
Do you believe the communist party
in this country would accept that?

1117
01:50:00,281 --> 01:50:03,737
Would they have any other choice
if the government fell?

1118
01:50:04,103 --> 01:50:07,290
But this is what I say today.
Tomorrow - we'll see.

1119
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:15,048
What would the Soviets say?
Your brothers and allies?

1120
01:50:16,193 --> 01:50:17,745
That's exactly the problem.

1121
01:50:17,806 --> 01:50:21,978
That's why I think we're discussing
an unrealistic, fantastical possibility.

1122
01:50:26,952 --> 01:50:29,179
Thank you, Lech.

1123
01:50:29,448 --> 01:50:31,909
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

1124
01:50:32,443 --> 01:50:34,701
It has been a pleasure talking to you.

1125
01:50:34,848 --> 01:50:38,573
Despite the headaches you gave me.

1126
01:50:39,969 --> 01:50:41,225
Good luck, Lech.

1127
01:50:45,346 --> 01:50:49,013
Solidarity! Solidarity!

1128
01:50:51,076 --> 01:50:55,120
AFTER YEARS OF STRUGGLE,
"SOLIDARITY", LED BY LECH WAŁĘSA,

1129
01:50:55,302 --> 01:51:00,143
MANAGED TO ORGANISE ROUND TABLE
TALKS WITH THE AUTHORITIES

1130
01:51:05,932 --> 01:51:07,441
WARSAW
5 APRIL, 1989

1131
01:51:07,502 --> 01:51:09,499
Our country is ruined.

1132
01:51:10,075 --> 01:51:12,717
It's difficult for
working people to live.

1133
01:51:13,171 --> 01:51:15,822
It sure wasn't done by the fairies,

1134
01:51:16,027 --> 01:51:18,869
but a system we did not choose.

1135
01:51:20,327 --> 01:51:22,782
We came to sit at this
table from prisons.

1136
01:51:24,138 --> 01:51:26,454
Look at that!
He got away in the end.

1137
01:51:27,088 --> 01:51:29,025
We remember all those

1138
01:51:29,303 --> 01:51:31,746
who shed their blood for 'Solidarity'.

1139
01:51:31,886 --> 01:51:34,536
Don't worry.
We'll get him eventually.

1140
01:51:34,651 --> 01:51:37,300
I think these talks

1141
01:51:37,787 --> 01:51:41,934
can be the beginning
of democracy and a free Poland.

1142
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:49,627
And a democratic election
is the first step.

1143
01:51:50,472 --> 01:51:54,773
Solidarity's "Gazeta Wyborcza"
8 pages of truth, 8 pages of freedom.

1144
01:51:57,499 --> 01:51:59,803
Support Lech Wałęsa's Team!

1145
01:52:03,342 --> 01:52:04,975
Vote for 'Solidarity'!

1146
01:52:05,036 --> 01:52:07,821
IN JUNE 1989 ELECTIONS
TO BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT

1147
01:52:07,882 --> 01:52:09,675
BROUGHT VICTORY TO "SOLIDARITY".

1148
01:53:02,307 --> 01:53:06,047
POLAND PAVED THE WAY TO FREEDOM
FOR OTHER COMMUNIST BLOCK COUNTRIES

1149
01:53:06,108 --> 01:53:09,745
ON 9 NOVEMBER, 1989 THE BERLIN WALL FELL.
A NEW EUROPE WAS BORN

1150
01:53:11,639 --> 01:53:14,020
WASHINGTON D.C.,
15 NOVEMBER, 1989
